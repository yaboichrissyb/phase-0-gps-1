#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I felt I had a pretty good handle on many of the git concepts. Sometimes I would get lost in the sequence of the workflow but ususally this could be helped through a "git status" command or from compulsively checking my working directory.
#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The exercise on reconciling merge conflicts helped me understand how to resolve issues that will inevitably arise when using git. I had been extremely careful to follow the instructions in previous exercises and thus had kept my errors to a minimum. As a result I did not know how to work myself out of problems like merge conflicts - this exercise greatly helped my comfort level in problem solving with git.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Our most memorable discussion was prompted by a question about deleting feature branches. It seems there are different schools of thought which our guide was able to relate to use which helped us determine the best course of action for our task at hand without being spoonfed a direction. I asked my pair whether cloning a repo automatically creates a directory or if the directory needs to be created beforehand. Although I suspected that creating an additional directory was not necessary, my pair was able to confirm my suspicions. This pattern continued for much of the session and allowed me to feel more confident in my actions.

#What still confuses you about git?

I am still somewhat confused by the HEAD concept.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was a bit difficult to be relaxed at first knowing that someone who is experienced is watching, listening, and evaluating you. After a while, I tried to focus on communicating with my pair and with completing the task at hand as carefully as possible. I think my pair and I worked a bit slower and were a bit more cautious knowing that it was a guided pairing session.
