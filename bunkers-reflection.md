**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I was a bit unclear on when and why you would need to use a pull command in your command line.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

It became clear why you would want to pull something from a remote repository to your local directory.  If something new is added by a partner or groupmate, you very well may want to add it to your local directory and not just have access through GitHub.  Merge conflicts were also clarified; what they are, why they occur, how they can be resolved and how they can be avoided.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

My partner and I were, I thought, pretty good about asking each other small clarifying questions as we worked through the challenge.  This was primarily just to make sure we were on the same page and to encourage open communication.  My partner did ask our guide a good question about best practice for when to delete branches.

**What still confuses you about git?**

I'm still not 100% clear on when to delete branches and when not to.  I still sometimes receive an error message when trying to delete a branch that says the branch is not fully merged even after merging it and checking its status.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was overally a good experience.  We had some small technical issues with our guide but it didn't seem to be a huge problem.  I think we probably worked more slowly together than we would have together, just because we were trading roles regularly and communicating as thoroughly as possible.
